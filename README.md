 <p>AsI was beginning to learn about HTML and CSS, I became more interested with web designing. However, there were moments I wish there was a more convienvt way for me design a framework. Coding and programing a layout from scratch can get tiresome. This inspired me to take a shot with BootStrap,a free and opensource directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. And I'm not going to lie, it made my life a lot easier, and helped me come up with ideas. In additon to trying out BootStrap, honed my skills for responsive design, ensuring web applications can render well on different devices. As a developer, you may get asked to design a website, and make it responsive to different devices.

 <p>For this project, I created a website to featuring myself, and some of the webages I developed in the last few weeks. This includes three HTML pages I linked -
  <ul>
    <li>index.html</li>
    <li>portfolio.html</li>
    <li>contact.html</li>
  </ul>
  Linking BootStrap's Grid System to all my HTML pages, I used it as a main source to create the layout ( containers, rows, & columns) for each page. I included a Navbar, where you can see each page I developed for the website. My Main Page, will give you a some info about me, so you can get to know a bit about me. The portfolio page, features some of my latest web developing projects. Lastly, if you happen to want to contact me, the third linked page is a form Bootstrap helped me design. It will allow you to leave your name, email address, and a message. Since it is my portfolio, I added some girly touches to it. The background is actually one of my favorite flowers. Not sure you can tell, but I love the color pink!

## Installation

When is comes to Responsive web designing, it is important to have you elemets fluid. For instance, each webpages has rows and columns, all which lie inside a container. In ordder for it to be displayed correctly on a regual page, you will want to mak the container, or even navbar fluid.

For my code editor, I use [visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which can be installed from their website.
<br>
For the frame work I used BootStrap, which has a lot of options and categories for you to choose from. The website [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), even teaches you how to work with their code to customize it to your liking. 

## Usage 

Here is an example of how i used containers, rows, and columns to design my webpage. Along with that, you see all the pages I linked, and referenced in my navbar.(code.PNG)
